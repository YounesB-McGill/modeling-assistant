"""
State machine learning corpus example, used for MODELS 2022 paper.

The example is based on the Umple state machine metamodel, where:

- A State has multiple transitions.
- A Transition (which we give the shorthand "trans") has a fromState and a toState.

Example instance of "Transition with correct event to wrong target state" mistake:

Instructor solution: A -> B
Student solution: A -> C; B exists

Parametrized response: The transition from A to C should point towards B instead.

The quiz is based on the following state machine taken from the Lethbridge and LaganiÃ¨re textbook:

```java
class TrafficLight {
  sm {
    RedLight { after 30s -> GreenLight; }
    GreenLight { after 25s -> YellowLight; }
    YellowLight { after 5s -> RedLight; }
  }
}
```

- Bad state name
- Bad state nesting
- Bad action
